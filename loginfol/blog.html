    <h2 class="head2">DATA ENTRY PART TIME JOB FRAUD</h2>
    <p>I am Aquarius. I am currently pursuing computer science and engineering specialized in cyber security. Currently that I apply a part time job then I got many calls then I lif the call they said that we are calling from nifty teach work pvt ltd that your work is to fill 700forms in 6 days. If you didn't complete that in 6 days, you have to pay 4000rs deposit. It will refund with your salary. I thought that ok I will complete in 6 days no problem we got salary 17,500rs" the I signed agreement that time I didn't thought that real or fake excitement. After that I asked to send him id but he send company address (it is fake). I checked in google and I asked that it is not their google. he said that this work is private side of company.</p>
    <p>I complete 570 forms in 5 days then suddenly id blocked that you submitted 2 blanks forms. If your id has to regenerated you have to pay 4000rs.If you didn't pay money your previous signed agreement. We will take legal action. I didn't do any thing wrong I did this much work. They ask what your father will do I said my father is police take legal action I will see you in court. Because of net issues we double click submit button automatically it will happen. When I said my father police he didn't talk for some time. It is cyber-crime they are targeting students and housewives.</p>
    <p>In that agreement no stamp and company address are fake. Then I called my parents and friends I information and said the situation they said don't pay any money. We will what happen I record there calls and inform to my professor about situation because i am a cyber student then my professor informs to cyber cell about this. he said that again, he calls you include me I will talk to them. After I search about this YouTube so many students are victims in this crime. So be careful about like this situation.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="head3">TELEGRAM FRAUD</h2>
    <p>I am one of the student like you. In WhatsApp some unknown person sent that would you like to do part time job. I said yes. She said that your job is to just give rating to our website and posts. For one post rating 150rs. They send post and website. I just give 5 star rating. I thought that for rating they gave money and I asked her. She said some story. Then she asked bank details for send money. I send bank details and she send money 150rs. I thought its genuine after that now fraud going to start. She gave one lady number and send message in telegram. I send message and she added me in telegram channel group. In that they send one list in that "if you deposit 1000rs cashback 1300(for newcomer),5000rs cashback 6500rs(group benefit),9000rs cashback 11700" etc. I thought its definitely scam then I stopped. Then I search in google and YouTube many members lost up to 100000rs like this. So be careful!</p>
